# Name Tag Stickers

This project dynamically generates personalized name tag stickers with attractive animations. Users can input names, and the stickers are displayed with smooth animations and a modern design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Sticker Creation**: Add new stickers in real-time by entering a name.

- **Customizable Template**: Easily modify styles or layouts in the template for your needs.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean and intuitive design with no clutter.

## How It Works

1. **Input Name**: Type a name in the input field at the top-right corner.
2. **Generate Sticker**: Click the "Add Name" button to create your personalized sticker.
3. **Dynamic Display**: Watch as the sticker rotates continuously and appears with fade-in effects.

## Technologies Used
